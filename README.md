## Casks for Apple Sillicon

Applications that support both Intel and Apple Sillicon are called Universal Binary, and they have the suffix `-universal`.
For example, BasicTex universal binary package name is `basictex-universal`.

Binaries that can be used only with Apple Sillicon are given a `-asr` suffix that means abbreviation for "Apple Sillicon Ready".
For example, installing Google Chrome for M1, following command. 

```
brew install google-chrome-asr
```
